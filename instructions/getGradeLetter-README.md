# Get Grade Letter Code Challenge

In this program, a function has been declared for you with the parameter `grade` being provided to you. Don't worry about exactly how the function works.

All that you know is that `grade` works just like a variable that has been declared, and that has already been assigned a value.

**You should not assign a numeric value to grade yourself.**

A `1`gradeLetter`1` variable has also been declared, you should assign it a string letter value according to the following:

### CODE PART:
Inside the `getGradeLetter()` function write a conditional statement:

- If the grade is greater or equal to 90, set gradeLetter to `"A"`.
- If the grade is less than 90 but greater or equal to 80, set `gradeLetter` to `"B"`.
- If the grade is less than 80 but greater or equal to 70, set `gradeLetter` to `"C"`..
- If the grade is less than 70 but greater or equal to 60, set `gradeLetter` to `"D"`..
- If neither of the cases above are true, set `gradeLetter` to `"F"`.

Hint: Use double quotes " " for your strings.
